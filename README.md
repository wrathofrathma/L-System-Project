# L-System Project
## Software Engineering  | Math and Computer Science Department

### Project Description
This application is made in Python. The goal of this application is to be able to easily visualize L-Systems, so that researchers can spend more time on the theory. Currently we are in version 1.01.  This application can be used to generate custom L-Systems in 2d or 3d.  You can also select from a number of preset L-Systems.  This program can be utilized to analyze the fractal dimensions with the built in Fractal Dimension calculator, and supports nondeterminism and context sensitive production rules.

### Future Release
 Currently there are no planed updates

### Installing the Application
The L-System Visualizer can be installed with the following command.

```
pip install L-System-Visualizer
```
### Running the Application
Run the following command in a terminal to run the application

```
python -m lsystem
```
