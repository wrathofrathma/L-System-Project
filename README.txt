# L-System Project
## Software Engineering I&II  | Math and Computer Science Department

### Project Description
This application is made in Python 3.7. The goal of this application is to be able to easily visualize L-Systems, so that researchers can spend more time on the theory. Currently we are in version 1 development, which has basic capabilities of accepting user input and displaying the L-System. It also allows for non-deterministic and context sensative L-Systems, along with a feature that estimates fractal dimension using the box counting method. This project is Team BRAWTs senior capstone project for Software Engineering. Our client is Micahel Bardzell, PhD in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Salisbury University.

### Future Release
For version two, we plan on having 3D LSystems avaiable to users.

### Getting Started
Clone the repository, then run the following line of code in the main directory:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python run.py```
